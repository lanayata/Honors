\chapter*{Acknowledgements}
Id like to thank Dr Stuart Marshall the supervisor of this project. He provided me with endless advice and mentorship over the course of this project making it a very positive experience. Thanks also goes to the Victoria University of Wellington Human Computer Interaction Group who were always free to help and provide me with assistance.
