\chapter{Requirements Analysis}\label{C:ra}
The design of the visualisation was based heavily on User Centered Design as it provided a method of user interface design as well as visualisation design. User Centered Design is a process in which the needs, wants, and limitatons of the end users of a system are given extensive attention. To achieve this, personas were created (also known as archetypal users), which are a personification the needs of a larger group of related users. These personas act as stand-ins for real users, describing them in terms of their goals and personal characteristics, and although they are fictitious, they are based on knowledge of real users. This design methodology supported my understanding of how users were likely to use the visualisation.
\\\\
An additional tool used during requirements analysis was User Scenarios which describe the foreseeable interactions of the user personas with the visualisation. A scenario is made up of a functional goal for the visualisation and describes how it is carried out by a persona. Both of these tools force you to think about the tasks needed for the visualisation and their context in the system as a whole. Once the personas and scenarios have been completed you can then start to design specific elements of the user interface and visualisation based on the requirements and interactions described in the scenarios.
\section{User models}
Below are the two personas that were used in the design of the visualisation for this project. They depict users that would use the visualisation in the context of a terminal or display in an observatory environment. 
\\\\
 and also provided clear defined personas that could be validated during evaluation of the visualistaion with real users that match the core values of the personas.
\subsection{John Truman (Primary Persona -  The interested layperson)}\
24 year old John is interested in planets and space and has a basic knowledge about both. John has used is used to playing computer games and using visualisations and is not overwhelmed understanding and using new systems. He finds that he learns better when provided with visual examples than when reading or listening to information. John is comfortable using keyboard and mouse when interacting with a computer but is also happy to use other gesture based methods. 
\subsection{Cara Thompson (Secondary Persona - )}

\section{Scenarios}
 A good use scenario does a number of things:
\begin{itemize}
 \item Describes the user's goals and motivations.
  \item Describes a specific task or tasks that need to be accomplished.
   \item Describes some of the interaction, with enough detail to make it compelling, but not so much detail as to be overwhelming.
    \item Provides a shared understanding for everyone on your team about what a user might want to do and how they might do it.
     \item Helps you construct the sequence of events that are necessary to address in your user interface.
     \item Can be sketchy, as long as it provokes ideas and discussion.
\end{itemize}
 \subsection{Scenario 1: View planets ordered by their similarity to earth and Kepler Object of Interest number}
 \subsection{Scenario 2: Select ranges for attributes of each planet displayed}

\subsection{Worlds: The Kepler Planet Candidates - Non Interactive}
 This animation \cite{worlds} shows  planet candidates found by NASA's Kepler mission. These candidates are animated in orbit around a single star. They are drawn to scale with accurate radii, orbital periods, and orbital distances. They range in size from 1/3 to 84 times the radius of Earth. Colors represent an estimate of temperature with red indicating warmest, and blue indicating coldest candidates.

\end{figure}
This animation is layed out very similarly to the Kepler Visualisation Tool that I am extending. This means that it provides insights into how my visualisation can be improved as Worlds is a much more visually appealing system. By researching how it displays its Exoplanets I can further improve my own visualisation.

\subsection{The Kepler Orrery and The Kepler Orrery 2 - Non interactive}
The Kepler Orrery \cite{orrery} illustrates the exoplanet candidates in their own solar systems. The orbit radii are to scale with respect to each other and planet sizes are to scale with respect to each other, but orbits and planet sizes are different scales. The colors are in order of semi-major axis: two-planet systems (242 in all) have a yellow outer planet; 3-planet (85) green, 4-planet (25) light blue, 5-planet (8) dark blue, 6-planet (1, Kepler-11) purple.

\end{figure}
This system exhibits small multiples, a grid of small similar graphics or charts, allowing them to be easily compared. This provides insights into how I can use small multiples to display information about groups of planets. This will be important for displaying which planets share a solar system.

\subsection{Celestia - Interactive}
Celestia \cite{celestia} is a free real-time space simulation that lets you visually experience the universe in three dimensions. It is an open source system written in C++. 
\begin{figure}[h!]

\end{figure}
This visualisation is much larger and more encompassing system than is needed for this project, as it is a full 3D space simulation. However is does offer insights into how to effectively portray planets and their orbits (See Figure 2.3). It also provides textures that can be used in my visualisation to depict what planets actually look like to increase user immersion.

\subsection{Kepler Visualisation Tool}
An existing system built with Processing is the Kepler Visualisation Tool\cite{kepler_github, kepler_article}. It is a simple visualisation focusing on displaying the candidate Exoplanets temperatures and their locations in relation to their distance from their nearest star, so that a sense of scale can be perceived. Each candidateâ€™s estimated size, orbital speed, and orbital separation is accurately depicted, and each planet is color-coded according to its estimated effective temperature.

The existing work in this system would serve as foundation for this project. Because much of the visual aspects, and initial data manipulation of the existing system are already complete. It means that implementing the features needed for this projects completion could be focused on more heavily and larger improvements to the existing system can be undertaken, such as better labeling and information displays and user interaction methods.
