\subsection{Worlds: The Kepler Planet Candidates - Non Interactive}
 This animation \cite{worlds} shows  planet candidates found by NASA's Kepler mission. These candidates are animated in orbit around a single star. They are drawn to scale with accurate radii, orbital periods, and orbital distances. They range in size from 1/3 to 84 times the radius of Earth. Colors represent an estimate of temperature with red indicating warmest, and blue indicating coldest candidates.

\end{figure}
This animation is layed out very similarly to the Kepler Visualisation Tool that I am extending. This means that it provides insights into how my visualisation can be improved as Worlds is a much more visually appealing system. By researching how it displays its Exoplanets I can further improve my own visualisation.

\subsection{The Kepler Orrery and The Kepler Orrery 2 - Non interactive}
The Kepler Orrery \cite{orrery} illustrates the exoplanet candidates in their own solar systems. The orbit radii are to scale with respect to each other and planet sizes are to scale with respect to each other, but orbits and planet sizes are different scales. The colors are in order of semi-major axis: two-planet systems (242 in all) have a yellow outer planet; 3-planet (85) green, 4-planet (25) light blue, 5-planet (8) dark blue, 6-planet (1, Kepler-11) purple.

This system exhibits small multiples, a grid of small similar graphics or charts, allowing them to be easily compared. This provides insights into how I can use small multiples to display information about groups of planets. This will be important for displaying which planets share a solar system.

\subsection{Celestia - Interactive}
Celestia \cite{celestia} is a free real-time space simulation that lets you visually experience the universe in three dimensions. It is an open source system written in C++.

This visualisation is much larger and more encompassing system than is needed for this project, as it is a full 3D space simulation. However is does offer insights into how to effectively portray planets and their orbits (See Figure 2.3). It also provides textures that can be used in my visualisation to depict what planets actually look like to increase user immersion.

\subsection{Kepler Visualisation Tool}
An existing system built with Processing is the Kepler Visualisation Tool\cite{kepler_github, kepler_article}. It is a simple visualisation focusing on displaying the candidate Exoplanets temperatures and their locations in relation to their distance from their nearest star, so that a sense of scale can be perceived. Each candidateâ€™s estimated size, orbital speed, and orbital separation is accurately depicted, and each planet is color-coded according to its estimated effective temperature.

The existing work in this system would serve as foundation for this project. Because much of the visual aspects, and initial data manipulation of the existing system are already complete. It means that implementing the features needed for this projects completion could be focused on more heavily and larger improvements to the existing system can be undertaken, such as better labeling and information displays and user interaction methods.
