\subsection{Visualisation Layout}
\subsubsection{Component Layout}
As the majority of the interaction and movement of visualisation elements occurs in the center of the window it caused a aspect ratio that SOMETHING SOMETHING. It was BETTER to use 2 vertical columns to view and control the visualisation as it had a higher aspect ratio which allowed more of the content to be seen on the screen at once thanks to the fact that the majority of computer screens have a wide ratio.
