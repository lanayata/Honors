\chapter{Related Work} 
This section discusses 4 existing visualisations that have a theme depicting
space or planets. Following the description, each visualisation is analysed to
discover which of the User Scenarios detailed previously existed within the
system.

\section{Worlds: The Kepler Planet Candidates - Non Interactive}
 This animation \cite{worlds} shows  planet candidates found by NASA's Kepler
mission. These candidates are animated in orbit around a single star. They are
drawn to scale with accurate radii, orbital periods, and orbital distances. They
range in size from 1/3 to 84 times the radius of Earth. Colors represent an
estimate of temperature with red indicating warmest, and blue indicating coldest
candidates.

\end{figure}
The layout of this animation is very similarly to the Kepler Visualisation Tool
that I am extending. This means that it provides insights into how my
visualisation can be improved as Worlds is a much more visually appealing
system. By researching how it displays its Exoplanets I can further improve my
own visualisation.
 \\\\
{\bf Scenario 1.} View planets ordered by their similarity to Earth:\\
Worlds has comprehensive functionality for comparing the different Exoplanets to
one another, however it does not offer any functionality regarding comparisons
to earth 
\\\\
{\bf Scenario 2.} Select ranges for attributes of each planet displayed:\\
Worlds does not offer any functionality for any filtering of Exoplanets, this
means that a user can only see all planets at once which can be overwhelming and
causes many of the exoplanets to be excluded from the user due to overlapping
and clustering. The reason that this is done is to convey how many Exoplanets
there are and how their scale differs among each Exoplanet
\\\\
{\bf Scenario 3.} Select planets to display more information:\\
Worlds is non interactive which means that users are not able to request further
information about the visualisation elements that they are seeing. This ability
to find out more is a key part of the interactive visualization that is needed
for this project.
\\\\
{\bf Scenario 4.} View planets in the same solar system:\\
Worlds shows all Exoplanets as if they are orbiting a single star. This allows
for each of them to be compared against one another easily. However this does
remove the ability for a user to see which planets are together in the same
solar system.


\section{The Kepler Orrery and The Kepler Orrery 2 - Non interactive}
The Kepler Orrery \cite{orrery} illustrates the exoplanet candidates in their
own solar systems. The orbit radii are to scale with respect to each other and
planet sizes are to scale with respect to each other, but orbits and planet
sizes are different scales. The colors are in order of semi-major axis:
two-planet systems (242 in all) have a yellow outer planet; 3-planet (85) green,
4-planet (25) light blue, 5-planet (8) dark blue, 6-planet (1, Kepler-11)
purple. 
\begin{figure}[H]

      \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{images/orrery.jpg}
  \caption{Image of The Kepler Orrery Visualisation}
\end{figure}
This system exhibits small multiples, a grid of small similar graphics or
charts, allowing them to be easily compared. This provides insights into how I
can use small multiples to display information about groups of planets. This
will be important for displaying which planets share a solar system.
\\\\
{\bf Scenario 1.} View planets ordered by their similarity to Earth:\\
Like worlds, The Kepler Orrery shows the similarities between each of the
exoplanets but does not have the functionality to allow users to make a
comparison to earth and our own solar system.
\\\\
{\bf Scenario 2.} Select ranges for attributes of each planet displayed:\\
As The Kepler Orrery is non interactive it is not possible to change the ranges
of the Exoplanets being displayed. However due to the layout of the
visualisation, which uses small multiples by grouping each solar system into its
own visualisation element it removes a lot of the issue of overcrowding and
overlapping.
\\\\
{\bf Scenario 4.} View planets in the same solar system:\\
This visualisation uses small multiples to great effect at displaying the
groupings of each panel into each solar system. By displaying each planet
orbiting its own star it removes the risk of confusion about what the planet is
actually orbiting which could be the case with Worlds.

\section{Celestia - Interactive}
Celestia \cite{celestia} is a free real-time space simulation that lets you
visually experience the universe in three dimensions. It is an open source
system written in C++. Celestia does not include any stars that are more than a
few thousand light-years from the Sun because the parallaxes of more distant
stars are too small to be accurately measured, meaning that it does not contain
the distant exoplanets discovered by the Kepler missoion. 
\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
      \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{images/celestia.jpg}
  \caption{Image of Celestia Visualisation}
\end{figure}
This visualisation is much larger and more encompassing system than is needed
for this project, as it is a full 3D space simulation. However is does offer
insights into how to effectively portray planets and their orbits (See Figure
2.3). It also provides textures that can be used in my visualisation to depict
what planets actually look like to increase user immersion.

{\bf Scenario 3.} Select planets to display more information:\\
Celestia allows users to view a large set of information about each of the
planets that it displays. The information it has avaible to users in toolbars
that users can access, examples of this information are radius, phase angle,
rotation speed, and temperature.  
\\\\
{\bf Scenario 4.} View planets in the same solar system:\\
Celestia allows users to explore a range of solar systems and view the planets
that are in them. This is because it is is a key feature of the experience that
Celesia tries to give users, ie letting them explore the vastness of space. 
\\\\
{\bf Scenario 6.} Select two planets to compare against one another:\\
Celestia allows this on a superficial and does not allow detailed information to
be compared. Celestia focusses on allowing users to experience the scale of
space and planets by exploring in a 3D space. This means that less importance is
placed on accessing detailed information.

\section{Kepler Visualisation Tool}
An existing system built with Processing is the Kepler Visualisation
Tool\cite{kepler_github, kepler_article}. It is a simple visualisation focusing
on displaying the candidate Exoplanets temperatures and their locations in
relation to their distance from their nearest star, so that a sense of scale can
be perceived. Each candidateâ€™s estimated size, orbital speed, and orbital
separation is accurately depicted, and each planet is color-coded according to
its estimated effective temperature.
\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
      \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{images/kepler.jpg}
  \caption{Kepler Visualisation Tool Orbital View}
\end{figure}

The existing work in this system would serve as foundation for this project.
Because much of the visual aspects, and initial data manipulation of the
existing system are already complete. It means that implementing the features
needed for this projects completion could be focused on more heavily and larger
improvements to the existing system can be undertaken, such as better labeling
and information displays and user interaction methods.
\\\\
{\bf Scenario 1.} View planets ordered by their similarity to Earth:\\
Like Worlds and the Kepler Orrery, The Kepler Visualisation Tool has
functionality to display the similarity of each Exoplanet to each other.
However, it also has some limited functionality of comparing these to earth
which the others lack. It does this by displaying Earth, Mars, and Jupiter with
the same colours, size, and orbit speed as the Exoplanets. This gives a user a
chance to comprehend the scale and difference of some of the Exoplanets.
\\\\
{\bf Scenario 2.} Select ranges for attributes of each planet displayed:\\
The Kepler Visualisation Tool allows users to change which attributes the
planets are ordered by on the vertical plane (Y axis) ie, by size or
temperature, but does not allow users to select ranges of these attributes to
filter the Exoplanets
