\chapter{Solution Design: Improved Kepler Visualisation Tool (IKVT)}\label{C:sd}
This section discusses the design of the deliverable visualisation, The Improved
Kepler Visualisation Tool(IKVT). It details
the key design decisions revolving around structure, asthetics, and
functionality that were made about the visualisation. 
% Description of tool
To help users to understand more about the planets outside of our solarsystem,
this project aims to improve an existing visualisation, The Kepler Visualisation
Tool that was discussed in the previous chapter, which whist displaying
exoplanets and some of thier features, it lacks interactivity for users trying
to use it to help comprehend the ...~. The IKVT expands on the preexisting
Kepler Visualisation Tool by adding key elements of interativity that are
missing with the existing visualisation as well as further enchancing the range
of data that is available to users about each exoplanet as well as adding a novel interactive approach by incorporating gesture based interaction with the visualisation.

To aid in the comprehesion of exoplanets 
% Aim of the visualisation ~

% Basic functionality of the visualisation - massive

% How visualisation represents each component

% Does it satisfy each requirements

% Discuss the features of other viusalisations incorporated
