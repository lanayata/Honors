\section{Future Work}
The work from this project can be taken further in many different ways depending on how it is intended to be used. There is the option of using the system as a terminal that users would use at an observatory or attraction where prior knowledge of the system is limmited and amount of time users would spend on the system would be small. In this case further expanding the user experience and improved Kinect interaction would be benificial as immersion would be the decider on its success. Another option for the system would be for a standalone desktop system that users would use multiple times and so prior knowledge of how to use the system could be expected. This would mean that more complex functionality could be introduced witht he expectation that it could be used by users. The systems current state could me modified to fit into either of these two options
