\section{Future Work}
The work from this project can be taken further in many different ways depending
on how it is intended to be used. There is the option of using the system as a
terminal that users would use at an observatory or attraction where prior
knowledge of the system is limited and amount of time users would spend on the
system would be small. In this case further expanding the user experience and
improved Kinect interaction would be beneficial as immersion would be the
decider on its success. Another option for the system would be for a standalone
desktop system that users would use multiple times and so prior knowledge of how
to use the system could be expected. This would mean that more complex
functionality could be introduced with he expectation that it could be used by
users. The systems current state could me modified to fit into either of these
two options.

\section{Supporting Tools for project}
%Other tools used to support me
By supporting this project methodology with other project management tools such
as Gantt charts [APPENDIX~] and work breakdown structures(WBS) [APPENDIX~], it
encouraged efficient documentation of planning and work completed in the project
as well as displaying the upcoming stages required to complete the project.

%Version Control
Version control was important for this project as it mitigated against the risks
of file system crashes and corruption, it also maintained effective revision
history that could be used to backtrack to or view changes that were made
earlier in the project. Version control was also valuable as it allowed me to
maintain multiple branches (versions) of my project that I could swap between.
This was important for the creation of the Keyboard and mouse system and the
Microsoft Kinect system as they were on separate branches in a repository. 

The version control tool that was used for this project was Git which allowed
for the repository to be hosted on the repository hosting web service Github.
This version control option was chosen due to the ease of use of as well as my
prior experience with Git which has all been positive. There was a minor
limitation of this choice as I used a free Github license which meant that the
repository would be open to the public.

%Meetings with supervisor
Weekly meetings with the supervisor of the project, Dr Stuart Marshall, were
used to provide guidance and ideas for innovation of the visualisation
throughout the project. These meeting ensured that vital components and
deliverables were implemented in the required timeframe and also provided a
sounding board for ideas for elements to be included in the visualization.
Another important aspect of having an involved supervisor was that he provided
me the guidance of an experienced academic which was indispensable when
navigating the administrative side of organizing delicate matters such as ethics
approval for human evaluation of the visualisation.
