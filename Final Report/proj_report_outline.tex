\begin{abstract}
Dr

Large amounts of information has been discovered about planets outside our solar
system, and this can be accessed by anyone from the Kepler
Exoplanets dataset \cite{datasetphl} \cite{dataset}. However this data is
complex and therefore not easily understood by laypeople who lack in depth
knowledge of stellar information. This is problematic as it
means that the data gathered about these planets is not being used
effectively to communicate to the masses. To resolve this a 3D interactive
visualisation called the Improved Kepler Visualisation Tool (IKVT) was created
by extending the exisiting Kepler Visualisation Tool to convey this information
in a way that
interested laypeople can understand. IKVT allows two methods of interaction by
keyboard \& mouse and by Microsoft Kinect sensor. This allows users, interested laypeople, to interact
with the visualisation via traditional means or by a more novel approach
respectively. This visualisation can be used as an
information source for those wanting to increase their knowledge about the
planets residing outside of our solar system. This report outlines the project
carried out and includes the planning of IKVT, its
implementation, and its user
evaluation to discover how effectively it fulfilled the system requirements
driving its
creation.
