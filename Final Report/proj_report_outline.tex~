\begin{abstract}


We have lots of information about planets outside our solar system. This can be accessed from a database by anyone. However this information is complex and cannot be easily understood by laypeople. This is a problem as it means that the information gained about these planets is not being used effectively to convey knowledge to the masses. To resolve this a visualisation has been created that can convey this information in a way that interested lay people can understand. The result of this project is a visualisation system that can be used as an information source for laypeople wanting to increase their knowledge about planets outside of our solar system. This report outlines the project carried out, the visualisation created, as well as the evaluation to discover its effectiveness at fullfilling the goals outlined.
