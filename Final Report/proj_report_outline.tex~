\begin{abstract}


We have large amounts of information about planets outside of our solar system. This can be accessed from a database by anyone. However this information is complex and cannot be easily understood by laypeople. This is a problem as it means that the information gained about these planets is not being used effectively to convey the intended information to the masses. To resolve this a visualisation has been created that can convey this information in a way that interested lay people can understand. This visualisation can be used as an information source for those wanting to increase their knowledge about the planets residing outside of our solar system. This report outlines the project carried out, the planning and decisions made, the visualisation created, and its evaluation to discover its effectiveness at fullfilling the goals driving its creation.
