\begin{abstract}


We have large amounts of information about planets outside of our solar system, and this can be accessed by anyone from the Kepler
Exoplanets dataset \cite{dataset}. However this information is often
complex not easily understood by laypeople who lack in depth knowledge of stellar objects. This is problematic as it
means that the data gathered about these planets is not being used
effectively to communicate to the masses. To resolve this a
visualisation has been created that can convey this information in a way that
interested laypeople can understand. This visualisation can be used as an
information source for those wanting to increase their knowledge about the
planets residing outside of our solar system. This report outlines the project
